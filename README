A perl script to aid minidisc-to-mp3 recording. 
It inserts a 2 second pause in between each song in a playlist thus enabling a 
minidisc to place an automatic trackmark.

Usage instructions: perldoc two-second-pause.pl

I do not use a MiniDisc anymore so this program is now unmaintained. I
originally wanted to write RhythmBox plugin but found the documentation very
unfriendly and lacking. A plugin would be the best solution, see NOTES below.

NOTES

If someone wants to start writing a RhythmBox plugin then here are some rough notes to get
you started. The notes are from the point of view of a recent Ubuntu LTS release.

I have included a dir in this repo called "plugin" containing how far I got in
writing the plugin (which isn't very far!).

See: http://live.gnome.org/RhythmboxPlugins/WritingGuide

and

/usr/share/doc/rhythmbox/development-reference
In a browser:
file:///usr/share/doc/rhythmbox/development-reference/index.html

For debugging, run RhythmBox like this:

rhythmbox -D two-second-pause

also

python -d <file> to run it through the parser

Mailing list response to a question about writing the plugin:
Rhythmbox emits signals when certain events occur, such as starting a track,
etc. You can have a function that gets called when the signal for finishing a
song is emitted (if there is one) which does what you want. I don't know the
specifics, but check the GTK and pyGTK documentation for more details.
